            <h3>My reasoning behind coding </h3>
            <img src="mom.jpg" alt="" height="200" width="200">
            <br>
            <p>There are many reasons in my case as to why I am interested in coding. For starters I'm a musician and I would like to be able to completely customize my webpage for my music to my stanard of professional. also just like any other mamas boy,
                I want to think that my Mother would be very proud of this decision, as well as my need to be able to support my babies</p>
            <br>
            <img src="daddy.jpg" alt="a(2)" height="200" width="200">
            <p>Another reason behind my interest in coding is my will to create a completely online DAW with he plugins that I personally require, as well as to make long distance colaboration not only more possble but a more exciting expieriance.</p>

            <p>Last but not least, as a musician I am forced to except that I may go across the world and i may sit sill, coding is what I see as my security Blanket that allows me to not worry over finances when my music career is stll struggling to take
                off.
